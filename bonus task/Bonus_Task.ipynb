        "## 📖 Storytime\n",
        "Welcome, young **data sorcerer** 🧙‍♂️! Your mission is to forge the *Exam Oracle 3000*, a mystical neural network that peers into the academic abyss to predict whether a student will **Pass** or **Fail** their exams. One misstep in your forward propagation spell, and the oracle will spew nonsense!\n",

        "The Council of AI Elders has decreed the following structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Input Layer**: 3 neurons (e.g., study hours, attendance %, quiz score).  \n",
        "- **Hidden Layers**: 1 layer, each with 3–5 neurons (your choice). These are the mystery chambers where exam fates are woven.  \n",
        "- **Output Layer**: 2 neurons:  \n",

        "2. Assign your own **weights and biases** manually, as if you're the god of exam grading (e.g., give \"study hours\" a higher weight).  \n",
        "3. Try **2–3 different sets** of weights and biases to see how the oracle shifts its predictions.  \n",
